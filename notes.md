### Notes:

-  Desktop view: in spec content container has  
    padding-top: 116px  
    padding-bottom: 152px  
   when we talked you told me the container has fixed width (750px), adjustable height, centered on the screen
   solution: padding top height from spec as padding top, bottom
   <br/>

-  MobileView: because its small screen its possible to display the whole image without loosing ratio, is that ok?

-  didn't send me X asset use instead red V
